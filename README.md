# Gloomhaven Scenario Full Setup
Code for the Steam Workshop mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1405547457

### Map Setup Tool
The original "Map Setup" tool is included, which only set up all the map tiles and overlays in its entirety.

### Full Setup Tool
A complete rewrite happened to create the "Full Setup" tool that allowed the option of hidden map generation and included monster spawning based on number of characters (including an option of standees or hex depending on preference).

The monster spawning relies on a function that Kijan obligingly added to the base mod.  So for other mods, a function will need to be written that spawns the monsters and ensures stopping when monster limit is reached.
